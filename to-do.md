To Do:
- display the author name instead of heading in area-header:left-page
- avoid heading as the last line of a page
- avoid leaving blanck space at the end of a page when there's a blanck line between paragraph
- why heading-3:first is not working?
- make page number starting with first page of the body (this can be reach in Ulysses be keeping separated front / back matter and manuscript, but this will require a different stylesheet for front / back matter because page numbering is defined in document-settings, making impossibile to export the full book in a single PDF, but requiring to export 3 PDF to be combined with Preview)
